## W3) Write a JavaScript Program to get the user registration data and push to array/local storage and data list in the new page.

### Problem Statement

**The task is to create a JavaScript program that handles user registration data. The program should be able to perform the following operations**:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect user registration data. This data typically includes information such as username, password, email, etc.

2. **Data Storage**: Store the collected data. The storage medium for this task is either an array or the local storage of the browser. Local storage allows the data to persist even after the browser is closed.

3. **Data Display**: Display the stored data on a new page. This involves retrieving the data from the storage medium and presenting it in a user-friendly format.

### Requirements

- Knowledge of JavaScript, particularly handling user inputs, arrays, and local storage.
- Understanding of how to manipulate the DOM to display data on a webpage.
- Familiarity with HTML and CSS for creating and styling the registration form and the data display page.

### Expected Outcome

At the end of this task, you should have a functional JavaScript program that can collect user registration data, store it, and display it on a new page.
